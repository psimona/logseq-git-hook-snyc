- > This is not meant to be a fully featured sync solution for Logseq but a simple way to sync between non mobile platforms and be able to resolve conflicts easily if you know your git foo.
- How to setup logseq git hook sync
	- Copy the `git-hooks` folder in the top of your logseq database
	- Be sure that the repo is configured to use SSH keys to be able to push without entering credentials
		- Note: other options work too but are not recommended
	- After clone on every machine execute once
		- For *NIX systems (Linux, MacOS, etc)`$ cd ./git-hooks && ./install-hooks-nix.sh`
		- For windows systems `$ cd ./git-hooks && ./install-hooks-windows.sh`
	- It might be necessary to restart logseq for the auto commit option to take effect
	- Changes will be committed every 60s and directly pushed thereafter if there are no conflicts
	- If there is an issue the corresponding git error will be shown in logseq
	- Git failing to push or pull due to merge issues must be resolved outside logseq
- Known limitations
	- Automatically pulling before committing works only on *NIX systems (Linux, Unix, MacOS)
